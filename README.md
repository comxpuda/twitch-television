# Twitch Television

A small web demo that renders a retro television UI and plays local videos inside the TV screen.

## Quick start

1. Install dependencies:

```powershell
npm install
```

2. Start the dev server:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

3. Open the app in your browser (Vite prints the URL, usually http://localhost:3000).

## How to use

- Click the left small button on the TV to choose a local video file (mp4, webm, etc.).
- Click the TV screen to play/pause the video.

That's it — simple and focused. Replace the sample video or drag a file in to test playback with audio.
